# Generative Adversarial Networks

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are neural networks capable of  unsupervised learning that pits one against the other, thus adversarial. One neural network generates data instances and the other evaluates them. For example, the generative network might create images and the evaluating network would gauge their authenticity. [GANs were introduced in a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) by Ian Goodfellow and other researchers at the University of Montreal, including Yoshua Bengio, in 2014. Goodfellow, Bengio and Aaron Courville co-authored [a well-known deep learning textbook](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). 

While difficult to tune, GANs have stimulated a lot of [interesting research and writing](https://blog.openai.com/generative-models/).
