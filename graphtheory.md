# Graph Theory and Machine Learning

This page is a WIP.

Here are three papers discussing how neural nets can be applied to data encoded in graphs.

* [DeepWalk: Online Learning of Social Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6652) (2014)

[DeepWalk is implemented in Deeplearning4j](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/1f8af820c29cc5567a2c5eaa290f094c4d1492a7/deeplearning4j-graph/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/graph/models/deepwalk/DeepWalk.java).

* [Learning multi-faceted representations of individuals from heterogeneous evidence using neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05198) (al et Jurafsky)

* [node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00653) (Stanford 2016)

## [Thought vectors](./thoughtvectors)

On a biological level, thoughts are literally graphs, graphs that capture the connections and action between neurons. Those graphs can represent a network of neurons whose connections fire in different ways over time as synapses fire, a dynamic flow of graphs.
