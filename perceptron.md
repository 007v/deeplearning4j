# A Beginner's Guide to Perceptrons

The perceptron, that neural network whose name reminds of how the 1950s talked about the future, is a simple algorithm intended to perform binary classification; i.e. the input belongs to a category of interest or it does not like, say, `fraud` or `not_fraud`, `cat` or `not_cat`.

The perceptron holds a special place in the history of neural networks and artificial intelligence, because the initial hype about its performance led to a rebuttal and backlash that cast a pall on neural network research for decades.
