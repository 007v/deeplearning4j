## Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Scala

### Deep Neural Networks

* [ScalNet](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/scalnet) is the Keras-like Scala API for Deeplearning4j. 

* Deeplearning.scala - ThoughtWorks built a simple library for creating complex neural networks called [Deeplearning.scala](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/DeepLearning.scala), which uses Skymind's [scientific computing library ND4J](https://nd4j.org/).

### Machine Learning 

* [Skymind Intelligence Layer CE](https://skymind.readme.io/v1.0.1/docs/quickstart) is a free machine learning platform that offers Scala notebooks with Zeppelin, which rely on Apache Spark for distributed training. 

* [Cortex](https://cortex.twitter.com/) - Twitter uses Scala for much of its big data stack.

### NLP

* For natural language processing in Scala, see [Scala NLP](http://www.scalanlp.org/).
