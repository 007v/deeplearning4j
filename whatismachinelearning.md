# What Is Machine Learning?

To define machine learning, we first need to define some of its components. 

The *machine* in machine learning refers to an algorithm, or a method of computation. You could say that an algorithm combines math and logic. What does it mean for an alorithm to learn? It means that the algorithm alters itself over time as it is exposed to data. It learns how to make better decisions based on that data, just as a human is said to learn when they manage to make better decisions based on experience. When humans learn, they alter the way they relate to the world. When algorithms learn, they alter the way they process data.
